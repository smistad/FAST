FAST (Framework for Heterogeneous Medical Image Computing and Visualization) is an open-source cross-platform framework with the main goal of making it easier to do processing and visualization of medical images on heterogeneous systems (CPU+GPU).

To start using the framework, please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/). To run the examples in this release download the [test data](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Test-data) and put it in the same folder as this readme.

A detailed description of the framework design can be found [on the project wiki](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Framework-Design) or in the research article:  
[FAST: framework for heterogeneous medical image computing and visualization](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-015-1158-5).
